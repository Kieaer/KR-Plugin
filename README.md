# KR-Plugin
Essentials. However, it's optimized for my server.<br>
But source code is free!<br>
I hope that my source code will be released to help other plugin developers.

## What's this plugin?
It's a plugin to be used in ``mindustry.kr`` server.<br>
The Essentials plugin is designed to be used on multiple servers, so it can't add special features to the server.

So I made it. For my server.<br>
Creating this plugin doesn't stop developing Essentials plugin.<br>
Some sources may apply to Essentials.
